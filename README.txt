Documentation
-------------

The documentation lives at http://dk.readthedocs.org/



Running the tests
-------------------

I use py.test to run the tests. I have also created a standalone
script for running the tests::

      runtests.py

I've also integrated py.test into `setup.py` so you can invoke the 
tests by::

      python setup.py test
